Description: A set of functions to perform distribution-free Bayesian analyses. 
             Included are Bayesian analogues to the frequentist Mann-Whitney U 
             test, the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test, Kendall's Tau Rank 
             Correlation Coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal's Gamma, McNemar's 
             Test, the binomial test, the sign test, the median test, as well as 
             distribution-free methods for testing contrasts among condition and 
             for computing Bayes factors for hypotheses. The package also 
             includes procedures to estimate the power of distribution-free 
             Bayesian tests based on data simulations using various probability 
             models for the data. The set of functions provide data analysts 
             with a set of Bayesian procedures that avoids requiring parametric 
             assumptions about measurement error and is robust to problem of 
             extreme outlier scores.
