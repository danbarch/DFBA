\arguments{
\item{Y1}{Numeric vector for one continuous variate}

\item{Y2}{Numeric vector for values paired with Y1 variate}

\item{a0}{shape parameter alpha of the prior beta distribution}

\item{b0}{shape parameter beta of the prior beta distribution}

\item{prob_interval}{Desired probability for interval estimates of the sign bias parameter phi (default is 0.95)}

\item{samples}{When method="small", the number of desired Monte Carlo samples per candidate value for phi (default is 30000 per candidate phi)}

\item{method}{(Optional) The method option is either "small" or "large". The "small" algorithm is based on a discrete Monte Carlo solution for cases where n is typically less than 20. The "large" algorithm is based on beta approximation model for the posterior distribution for the omega_E parameter. This approximation is reasonable when n > 19. Regardless of n the user can stipulate which method that they desire. When the method option is omitted the program selects the appropriate procedure.}

\description{
Given two continuous, paired variates \code{Y1} and \code{Y2},
computes the sample \code{T_plus} and \code{T_negative} statistics for the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test and provides a Bayesian analysis for the population
sign-bias parameter \code{phi_w}, which is the population proportion of
positive differences.
}
\details{
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is the frequentist nonparametric counterpart to
the paired \emph{t}-test. The procedure is based on the rank of the difference
scores \emph{d} = \code{Y1} - \code{Y2}.
The ranking is initially done on the absolute value of the nonzero \code{d} values,
and each rank is then multiplied by the sign of the difference. Differences
equal to zero are dropped. Since the procedure is based on only ranks of the
differences, it is robust with respect to outliers in either the \code{Y1} or
\code{Y2} measures. The procedure does not depend on the assumption of a
normal distribution for the two continuous variates.

The sample \code{T_plus} statistic is the sum of the ranks that have a positive
sign, whereas \code{T_negative} is the positive sum of the ranks that have a
negative value. Given \emph{n} nonzero \emph{d} scores, \code{T_plus} +
\code{T_negative} = \emph{n}(\emph{n} + 1)/2. Tied ranks are possible, especially
when there are \code{Y1} and \code{Y2} values that have low precision. In
such cases, the Wilcoxon statistics are rounded to the nearest integer.

The Bayesian analysis is based on a parameter \code{phi_w}, which is the
population proportion for positive \emph{d} scores. The default prior for \code{phi_w}
is a flat beta distribution with shape parameters \code{a0} = \code{b0} =1,
but the user can stipulate their preferred beta prior by assigning values for
\code{a0} and \code{b0}. The \code{prob_interval} input, which has a default
value of .95, is the value for interval estimates for the \code{phi_w}
parameter, but the user can alter this value if they prefer.

There are two cases for the Bayesian analysis - one for a small number of
pairs and another for when there is a large number of pairs. The \code{method = small}
sample algorithm uses a discrete approximation where there are 200 candidate
values for phi_w, which are .0025 to .9975 in steps of .005. For each
candidate value for \code{phi_w}, there is a prior and posterior probability.
The posterior probability is based on Monte Carlo sampling toapproximate the
likelihood for obtaining the observed  Wilcoxon statistics. That is, for each
candidate value for \code{phi_w}, thousands of Monte Carlo samples are
generated for the signs on the numbers (1,2, ..., n) where each number is
multiplied by the sign. The proportion of the samples that result in the
observed Wilcoxon statistics is an estimate for the likelihood value for that
candidate \code{phi_w}. The likelihood values along with the prior result in
a discrete posterior distribution for \code{phi_w}. The default for the
number of Monte Carlo samples per candidate \code{phi_w} is the input
quantity called \code{samples}. The default value for samples is 30000,
but this quantity can be altered by the user.

Chechile (2018) empirically found that for large \emph{n} there was a beta
distribution that approximated the quantiles of the discrete, small sample
approach. This approximation is reasonably accurate for \emph{n} > 24, and is
used when \code{method = "large"}.

If the \code{method} argument is omitted, the function employs the method
that is appropriate given the sample size. Note: the \code{method = "small"}
algorithm is slower than the algorithm for \code{method = "large"}; for cases
where \emph{n} > 24, \code{method = "small"} and \code{method = "large"} will
produce similar estimates but the former method requires increased
processing time.
