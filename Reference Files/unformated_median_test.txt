Bayesian Median Test

Description

Given two independent groups where the variate for each
group is continuous, the function does a Bayesian
analysis to see if it is more likely than would be
expected for an above-median value to be from one of the
groups.


Usage

dfba_median_test(
  E,
  C,
  a0=1,
  b0=1
)

Arguments

E		Numeric vector of values for the
		continuous measurements for group 1,
		which generically is denote as E for
		the experimental group

C		Numeric vector of values for the
 		continuous measurements for group 2,
		which is generically denoted as C
		for the ontrol group

a0		The first shape parameter for the prior
		beta distribution for the binomial
		parameter phi (default is 1)

b0		The second shape parameter for the
		prior beta distribution for the
		binomial parameter phi (default is 1)



Details

Given continuous measurements E and C from two separate
and independent groups, a combined sample median value can
be computed. For the frequentist median test, a 2x2 table
is created. Row 1 consists of the frequencies of the above-
median responses in terms of the two groups (i.e., nEabove
and nCabove). Row 2 has the respective frequencies for the
scores that are at or below the combined median (i.e.,
nEbelow and nCbelow). See Siegel & Castellan (1988) for
the details concerning the frequentist median test.


Chechile (2020) provided an alternative Bayesian
analysis for the median-test procedure of examining
continuous data in terms of the categorization of the scores
as being either above the combined median or not. The
frequencies in row 1 (above median response) are just
binomial frequencies in terms of the group origin (i.e.,
E versus C). From a Bayesian perspective, a population phi
parameter can be defined for the population proportion of E
scores that are above the combined sample median. Similarly
the frequencies for the scores at or below the combined
sample median can also be examined, but the corresponding
population proportion in the E condition must be (1-phi).
Thus, it is sufficient to only examine the above-median
frequencies to make an inference about the phi parameter.
Since this is a binomial problem, the prior and posterior
distributions for the population phi parameter belong to
the beta family of distributions. The default prior for
this function is the uniform distribution (i.e, a0=b0=1),
but the user can adjust that prior. The posterior shape
parameters for phi are post.a=a0+nEabove and
post.b=b0+nCabove.

Because the number of scores in groups E and C might
be very different, it is important to examine the
phi parameter relative to an expected baserate value
from the sample. For example, suppose that there are
90 scores from the E group and 10 scores from the C
group, then the 50 scores that are above the combined
median should be examined to see if phi is greater
than .9. If there were no difference between the E
and C conditions whatsoever in this hypothetical
example, then about 90 percent of the above-median
values should be from the E group. If the posterior
phi parameter is substantially above the group E
baserate, then it would support the hypothesis that
group E has larger values than group C in the
population.

The dfba_median_test() provides the descriptive sample
information of the combined median as well as the
entries for a table for the frequencies for the E and
C scores that are above the median as well as the
frequencies for the E and C scores at or below the
median. The function also provides the prior and
posterior probabilities that the E and C groups
exceeding their respective baserates for a score being
above the median. The function also evaluates the
hypotheses that the E and C response rates for the
above-median responses exceeding their baserate.
Bayes factors are provided for these hypothesis.


Because the Bayesian median test ignores the rank-
order information that is available, this procedure
has less power than the Bayesian Mann-Whitney
analysis that can be computed for the same data.
Nonetheless sometimes researchers are interested if
condition differences are so strong that even a
lower power median test can detect the difference.
