dfba_beta_descriptive {DFBA}			R Documentation

Descriptive Statistics for a Beta Distribution 

Description

Given the two shape parameters for a beta distribution, the function
provides central tendency statistics, interval limits, and density 
and cumulative probabilities.

Usage

dfba_descriptive(
  a,
  b,
  prob_interval=.95
 )

Arguments

a		The first shape parameter for the beta distribution

b		The second shape parameter for the beta distribution

prob_interval	Desired probability within interval limits (default
		is .95)

Details

The density function for a beta variate is f(x)= Kx^(a-1)(1-x)^(b-1) 
for x in the [0,1] interval and f(x)=0 for all other x, and  K is
Gamma(a+b)/Gamma(a)Gamma(b) with Gamma being the gamma function 
(Johnson, Kotz, & Balakrishnan, 1995). The two shape parameters
a and b must be positive values. While base R has functions
for the beta distribution, the dfba_beta_descriptive () function 
provides some additional features not included in base R. The 
function provides the mean, median, and mode for a beta variate in 
terms of its two shape parameters. 

While the mean and median are straightforward, there are several
conditions that result in an undefined mode. When either (1) a=b=1,
(2) a<1, or (3) b<1, the mode is undefined. For example when a=b=1,
the function is the uniform distribution, which does not have a 
modal value. The other cases above result in the density function 
diverging at either x=0 or x=1. The program returns the value of 
NA for the mode for all the cases where a unique mode does not 
exist.


For interval estimation, the function finds an equal-tail interval 
limits in all cases, and it also provides the highest-density limits
when there is well defined mode. When the mode does not exist, the
function returns NA for the limits for the highest-density interval (HDI).
For interval estimation, the probability between the lower and
upper limit is the probability specified in the `prob_interval' input.
If the dfba_beta_descriptive function is wrapped into a R object, then
the user also can obtain a dataframe that has density and cumulative
probability information that can be used for plotting.
