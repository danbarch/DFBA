Details

The binomial distribution with size = n and probability = phi has 
discrete probabilities p(x) = choose(n, x) phi^x (1-phi)^(n-x),
where the choose() function is n!/x!(n-x)! and where x is an integer
from 0 to n in steps of 1. The binomial model assumes a Bernoulli 
process of independent trials where there are binary outcomes that 
have the same probability (say phi) for a response in one of the two
categories and a probability of (1-phi) for the other category. Before
any data are collected there are n+1 possible values for x number of 
outcomes in category 1 and n-x number of outcomes in category 2. 
The binomial distribution is a likelihood distribution. A likelihood 
is the probability of an outcome given a specific value for the 
population rate parameter. Yet for real applications, the population
parameter is not known. All that is known are the outcomes observed 
from a set of binomial trials. The binomial inference problem is 
estimating the population phi parameter based on the sample data. 

The frequentist approach to statistics is based on the relative 
frequency method of assigning probability values (Ellis, 1842). From 
this framework, there are no probabilities for anything that does not
have a relative frequency (von Mises, 1957). In frequency theory the
phi parameter does not have a relative frequency, so it cannot have a
probability distribution. From a frequentist framework, a value for 
the binomial rate parameter is assumed, and there is a discrete 
distribution for the n+1 outcomes for x from 0 to n. The discrete 
likelihood distribution has relative frequency over repeated 
experiments. Thus, for the frequentist approach, x is a random 
variable, and phi is an unknown fixed constant. Frequency theory 
thus delibrately eschews the idea of the binomial rate parameter 
having a probability distribution. Laplace (1774) had previously 
employed a Bayesian approach of treating the phi parameter as a
random variable. Yet Ellis and other researchers within 
the frequentist tradition delibrately rejected the Laplace/Bayes 
approach. For tests of a null hypothesis of an assumed phi value,
the frequentist approach either continues to assume the null
hypothesis or it rejects the null hypothesis depending on the 
likelihood of the observed data plus the likelihood of more 
extreme outcomes. The confidence interval is the range of phi 
values where the null hypothesis of specific phi values would be
retained given the observed data (Clopper & Pearson, 1934). Yet
the frequentist confidence interval is not a probability 
interval since population parameters cannot have a probability
distribution with frequentist methods. Frequentist statisticians
were well aware that if the phi parameter had a distribution, then
the Laplace/Bayes approach would be correct.  


Bayesian statistics rejects the frequentist theoretical decisions 
as to what are the fixed constants and what is the random variable 
that can take on a range of values. From a Bayesian framework,
probability is anything that satisfies the Kolmogorov (1933) axioms,
so probabilities need not be limited to processes that have a 
relative frequency. Importantly probability can be a measure of 
information or knowledge provided that the probability 
representation meets the Kolmogorov axioms. Given binomial data, 
the population binomial rate parameter phi is unknown, so it is 
represented with a probability distribution for its possible values. 
This assumed distribution is the prior distribution. Furthermore, 
the quantity x for the likelihood distribution above is not
a random variable once the experiment has been conducted. 
If there are n1 outcomes for category 1 and n2=n-n1 outcomes in
category 2, then these are fixed values. While frequentist statistics
computes both the likelihood of the observed outcome as well as the 
likelihood for unobserved outcomes that are more extreme, in 
Bayesian inference it is only the likelihood of the observed outcome
is computed. From the Bayesian perspective the inclusion of 
unobserved outcomes in the analysis violates the likelihood 
principle (Berger & Wolpert, 1988). A number of investigators 
have found paradoxes with frequentist procedures when the 
likelihood principle is not used (e.g., Lindley & Phillips,
1976; Chechile, 2020). Also the use of strictly computing only 
the likelihood of the observed data results in Bayesian statistics
with the likelihood for the binomial being proportional to
phi^n1 (1-phi)^n2. In Bayesian statistics the proportionality 
constant is not needed because it appears in both the numerator
and the denominator of Bayes theorem, so it cancels. See 
Chechile (2020) for more extensive comparisons between 
frequentist and Bayesian approaches with a particular focus on
the binomial model.

 
Given a beta distribution prior for the binomial phi parameter, 
it has been shown that the resulting posterior distribution
from Bayes theorem is another member of the beta family of
distribtions (Lindley & Phillips, 1976). This property of the
prior and posterior being in the same distributional family is 
colled conjugacy. The beta distribution is a natural Bayesian 
conjugate function for all Bernoulli processes where the 
likelihood is proportional to phi^n1 (1-phi)^n2 (Chechile, 2020).

The density function for a beta variate is
 f(phi)= C phi^(a-1)(1-phi)^(b-1) 
for phi in the [0,1] interval and f(phi)=0 for all other phi, and 
the constant C is Gamma(a+b)/Gamma(a)Gamma(b) with Gamma being the
gamma function (Johnson, Kotz, & Balakrishnan, 1995). The two shape
parameters a and b must be positive values. If the beta prior shape
parameters are a0 and b0, then the posterior beta shape parameter 
are post.a=a0+n1 and post.b=b0+n2. The default prior for the 
dfba_binomial() function is a0=b0=1, which corresponds to the 
uniform prior. The user can adjust the a0 and b0 for other 
possible prior distributions.

Thus the Bayesian inference for the unknown binomial rate parameter
phi is the posterior beta distribution with shape parameters of 
post.a and post.b. The dfba_binomial () function, uses the 
dfba_beta_descriptive () function to find the centrality point 
estimates (i.e., the mean, median, and mode) and to find two interval 
estimates that contain the probability specified in the 
`prob_interval' input. One interval has equal-tail 
probabilities and the other interval is the highest-density 
interval. Users can use the dfba_beta_bayes_factor () function 
to test hypotheses about the phi parameter.
