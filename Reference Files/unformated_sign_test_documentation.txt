Bayesian Sign Test 

Description

Given two paired continuous variates Y1 and Y2, the program 
provides a Bayesian sign test to assess the positivity rate
for the difference Y1-Y2.

Usage

dfba_sign_test(
  Y1,
  Y2,
  a0=1,
  b0=1,
  prob_interval=.95
 )

Arguments

Y1		Vector of the continuous measurements for 
		the first condition
		
Y2		Vector of the continuous values paired 
		with the Y1 vector for the values in a 
		second condition

a0		The first shape parameter for the prior
		beta distribution for the positive-sign
		rate parameter (default is 1)

b0		The second shape parameter for the prior
		beta distribution for the positive-sign
		rate parameter (default is 1)

prob_interval	Desired probability within interval limits
		for interval estimates of the positivity
		rate parameter (default is .95)

Details
 
Given two paired continuous variates (denoted as Y1 and Y2) 
for two within-block conditions, statistical tests for 
condition differences examine the difference measure d=Y1-Y2.
The t-test is a conventional frequentist parametric 
procedure to assess the d values. There are also two common 
frequentist nonparametric tests for assessing condition 
differences (i.e., the sign test and the Wilcoxon signed-
rank test). The sign test is less powerful than the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test (Siegel & Castellan, 1988). The appeal of  
the sign test for some researchers is that it is simple, and 
in some cases, it is sufficient for demonstrating a strong 
condition difference. 

The dfba_sign_test() function provides a Bayesian 
version for the sign test, whereas the function 
dfba_wilcoxon() provides the Bayesian signed-rank test.
While the Wilcoxon procedure uses both rank and sign
information, the sign test only uses sign information. 
The dfba_sign_test() program finds the number of positive 
and negative d values, which are n_pos and n_neg 
respectively. Note that it is standard both in the 
frequentist sign test and in the frequentist Wilcoxon 
signed-rank procedure to remove the d values that are zero. 
Consequently, the signs for the nonzero d values are 
binary, so the posterior is a beta distribution with shape
parameters post.a, and post.b where post.a=a0+n_pos and 
post.b=b0+n_neg and where a0 and b0 are the respective
first and second beta shape parameters for the prior.
The default prior is a uniform distribution, but the user
can adjust the inputs values for a0 and b0 to employ a
different prior.

The function estimates the population rate for positive 
signs by calling the dfba_beta_descriptive () function 
using the computed post.a and post.b values. Since
interest in the sign test is focused on the null 
hypothesis that the positivity rate is less than or 
equal to .5, the dfba_sign_test () calls the 
dfba_beta_bayes_factor () program to obtain the prior
and posterior probabilities for the alternative
hypothesis that the positivity rate is greater than
.5. Also the Bayes factors BF10 and BF01 are found, 
where BF01=1/BF10. If the BF01 Bayes factor is large, 
then that is support for the null hypothesis; whereas
if BF10 is large, then that is support for the 
alternative hypothesis.
