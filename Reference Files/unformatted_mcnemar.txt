Bayesian Repeated-Measurement McNemar Test for Change 

Description

Given a randomized-block or repeated-measurement design 
where the response is coded as either 0 or 1, the 
function examines the subset of cases where there is a 
change in the response between the two tests. The function
provides a Bayesian analysis of the population change rate
phi_rb between the two measurements. 

Usage

dfba_mcnemar(
  n_10,
  n_10,
  a0,
  b0,
  prob_interval
)

Arguments

n_01		The number of cases where the first response
		is 0 and the second response is 1.

n_10		The number of cases where the first response
		is 1 and the second response is 0.

a0		The first shape parameter for the prior beta
		distribution for the phi_rb parameter

b0		The second shape parameter for the prior beta
		distribution for the phi_rb parameter

prob_interval	Desired probability for interval estimates 
 		for phi_rb (default is .95)


Details

Sometimes researchers are interested in the detection of a 
change in the response rate pre- and post-treatment. The 
frequentist McNemar test is a nonparametric test that 
examines the subset of binary categorical responses where
the response changes between the two tests (Siegel & 
Castellan, 1988). The frequentist test assumes the null 
hypothesis that the change rate is .5. Chechile (2020) 
pointed out that the subset of change cases are binomial
data, so a Bayesian analysis can be done for the population
response-switching rate phi_rb. Both the prior and 
posterior distribution for phi_rb are beta distributions.

The user should be aware that the McNemar test is a change-
detection assessment of a binary response. To illustrate
this fact, consider the hypothetical case of a sample of
50 people who are evaluating two political candidates 
before and after a debate. Suppose 26 people like Candidate
A on both tests, 14 people like Candidate B on both tests,
but 9 people initially like Candidate A but switched to
liking Candidate B after the debate, whereas only 1 person
initially liked Candidate B and switched to liking 
Candidate A after the debate. Despite the fact that the 
study had 50 participants, it is only the 10 people who 
switched their preference that are being studied with the
McNemar test. Among this subset, there is evidence that 
Candidate B did better on the debate. Nonetheless, after 
the debate the overall rate for Candidate A still is 
larger since 27 people prefer A (54%), but this level of
support is down from the initial level of 35 people (70%).


The dfba_mcnemar () function requires two inputs, n_01 and 
n_10, which are respectively the number of (0-to-1) changes
and the number of (1-to-0) switches in the binary response
between the two tests. Since the cases where there is a 
switch is itself a binomial process, the prior and 
posterior distributions for phi_rb are beta distributions. 
The prior distribution shape parameters are a0 and b0. The
default is a uniform distribution (i.e., a0=b0=1); 
however, users can employ a different prior by adjusting 
the a0 and b0 values. The `prob_interval' input 
stipulates the probability within the equal-tail interval
limits for phi_rb. This input has a default of .95, but
that value can be adjusted by the user. 



Besides computing the posterior mean, posterior median,
equal-tail interval limits, and the posterior probability 
that phi_rb > .5, the function also computes two Bayes 
factor values. One is the point Bayes factor BF10 against 
the null hypothesis that phi_rb=.5. The second Bayes 
factor BF10 is the interval Bayes factor against the null 
hypothesis that phi_rb is equal or less than .5. If the 
interval Bayes factor BF10 is very low, then there is 
support to some degree for the null hypothesis that phi_rb
is less than .5. In this case the Bayes factor BF01 in 
support of the interval null hypothesis can found by the
user with the calculate of BF01=1/BF10.
