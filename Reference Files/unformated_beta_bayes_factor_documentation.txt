Bayes Factor for Posterior Beta Distribution

Description

Given a beta posterior distribution and given a prior for the
variate, this function computes the Bayes factor for either point
or interval null hypotheses.

Usage

dfba_beta_bayes_factor{
   a,
   b,
   method,
   null,
   a0,
   b0
  )

Arguments

a	The first shape parameter for the posterior beta
	distribution

b	The second shape parameter for the posterior beta
	distribution

method	Input is either "interval" if the null hypothesis is a
	range on the [0,1] interval or it is "point" if the null
	hypothesis is a single number in the [0,1] interval

null	If method="interval", then the null input is vector of
	two values, which are lower and upper limits for the null
	hypothesis; where if method="point", then the null input
	is single number, which is the null hypothesis value

a0	The first shape parameter for the prior beta distribution
	(default is 1)

b0	The second shape parameter for the prior beta distribution
	(default is 1)

Details

For a binomial variate with n1 successes and n2 failures, the
Bayesian analysis for the population success rate parameter phi is
distributed as a beta density function with shape parameters `a'
and `b' for a=n1+a0 and b=n2+b0 where a0 and b0 are the shape
parameters for the prior beta distribution. It is common for users
to be interested in testing hypotheses about the population phi
parameter. The Bayes factor is useful to assess if either the null
or the alternative hypothesis are credible.

There are two types of null hypotheses -- an interval null hypothesis
and a point null hypothesis. For example, an interval null hypothesis
might be phi ≤ .5 with the alternative hypothesis being phi>.5,
whereas a point null hypothesis might be phi=.5 with the alternative
being phi ≠ .5. It is conventional to call the null hypothesis H_0
and to call the alternative hypothesis H_1. For frequentist null
hypothesis testing, H_0 is assumed to be true, to see if this
assumption is likely or not. With the frequentist approach the null
hypothesis cannot be proved since it was assumed in the first place.
With frequetist statistics H_0 is thus either retained
as assumed or it is rejected. Unlike the frequentist approach,
Bayesian hypothesis testing does not assume either H_0 or H_1; it
instead assumes a prior distribution for the population parameter
phi, and based on this assumption arrives at a posterior
distribution for the parameter given the data of n1 and n2 for the
binomial outcomes.

There are two related Bayes factors - BF10 and BF01 where BF01=1/BF10.
When BF10>1 there is more support of the alternative hypothesis,
whereas when BF01>1 there is more support for the null hypothesis.
Thus in Bayesian hypothesis testing it is possible to build support
for either H_0 or H_1. In essence the Bayes factor is a measure of the
relative strength of evidence. There is no standard guideline
for recommending a decision about the prevailing hypothesis, but
several statisticians have made some suggested criteria. Jeffreys
(1961) suggested that a Bayes factor > 10 was "strong" and BF>100
was "decisive"; however, Kass and Raffrey (1995) suggested that
BF>20 was "strong" and BF>150 was "decisive". Chechile (2020) argued
from a decision-theory framework for a third option for the user to
decide "not to decide" if the prevailing Bayes factor is not
sufficiently large. From this decision-making perspective, Chechile
(2020) suggested that BF>19 was a "good bet-too good to disregard",
whereas BF>99 was "a strong bet-irresponsible to avoid" and
BF>20,001 was "virtually certain". Yet Chechile pointed out that
despite the Bayes factor value there is often some probability,
however small, for either hypothesis. Ultimately each academic
discipline has to set the standard for their field for the
strength of evidence. Yet even when the Bayes factor is below
the user's threshold for making claims about the hypotheses, the
value of the Bayes factor from one study can be nonetheless
valuable to other researchers and might be combined via a product
rule in a meta-analysis. So, the value of the Bayes factor has
a descriptive utility.

The Bayes factor BF10 for an interval null is the ratio of the
posterior odds of H_1 to H_0 divided by the prior odds of H_1 to H_0.
Also the converse Bayes factor BF01 is the ratio of posterior odds of
H_0 to H_1 divided by the prior odds of H_0 to H_1; hence BF01=1/BF10.
If there is no change in the odds ratio as a function of new data
being collected, then BF10=BF01=1. But if evidence is more likely for
one of the hypotheses, then either BF10 or BF01 will be greater than
1.

The population parameter phi is distributed on the continuous interval
[0,1]. The prior and posterior beta distribution are probability
density displays. Importantly this means that no point has a nonzero
probability. Alternatively it means that the probability for any
mathematical point is zero. For this reason all point null hypotheses
have a probability measure of zero, but they can have a probability
density that can be different for prior and posterior distributions.
Interestingly there still is a meaningful Bayes factor for a point
hypothesis. As described in Chechile (2020)
BF10 = [P(H1|D)/P(H1)][P(H0)/P(H0|D)] where D denotes the data. The
first term in this equation is 1/1=1. But the second term is of the
form of 0/0, which appears to undefined. However, by using
L'Hospital's rule, it can be proved the term P(H0)/P(H0|D) is the
ratio of prior probability density at the null point divided by the
posterior probability density. This method for finding the Bayes
factor for a point is called the Savage-Dickey method because of the
separate contributions from both of those statisticians (Dickey &
Lientz, 1970).
