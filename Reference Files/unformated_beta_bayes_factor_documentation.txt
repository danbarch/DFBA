Bayes Factor for Posterior Beta Distribution 

Description

Given a beta posterior distribution and given a prior beta 
distribution variate, this function computes the Bayes factor
for either point or interval null hypotheses.

Usage

dfba_beta_bayes_factor{
   a,
   b,
   method,
   null,
   a0,
   b0
  )

Arguments

a	The first shape parameter for the posterior beta 
	distribution

b	The second shape parameter for the posterior beta
	distribution

method	Input is either "interval" if the null hypothesis is a 
	range on the [0,1] interval or it is "point" if the null
	hypothesis is a single number in the [0,1] interval

	two values, which are lower and upper limits for the null
	hypothesis; where if method="point", then the null input
	is single number, which is the null hypothesis value

Details

For a binomial variate with n1 successes and n2 failures, the 
Bayesian analysis for the population success rate parameter phi is
distributed as a beta density function with shape parameters `a' 
and `b' for a=n1+a0 and b=n2+b0 where a0 and b0 are the shape 
parameters for the prior beta distribution. It is common for users
to be interested in testing hypotheses about the population phi
parameter. The Bayes factor is useful to assess if either the null
or the alternative hypothesis are credible. 

There are two types of null hypotheses -- an interval null hypothesis
and a point null hypothesis. For example, an interval null hypothesis
might be phi ≤ .5 with the alternative hypothesis being phi>.5, 
whereas a point null hypothesis might be phi=.5 with the alternative 
being phi ≠ .5. It is conventional to call the null hypothesis H_0 
and to call the alternative hypothesis H_1. For frequentist null 
hypothesis testing, H_0 is assumed to be true, to see if this 
assumption is likely or not. With the frequentist approach the null
hypothesis cannot be proved since it was assumed in the first place. 
With frequetist statistics H_0 is thus either retained
as assumed or it is rejected. Unlike the frequentist approach, 
Bayesian hypothesis testing does not assume either H_0 or H_1; it 
instead assumes a prior distribution for the population parameter 
phi, and based on this assumption arrives at a posterior
distribution for the parameter given the data of n1 and n2 for the 
binomial outcomes. 

There are two related Bayes factors - BF10 and BF01 where BF01=1/BF10. 
When BF10>1 there is more support of the alternative hypothesis, 
whereas when BF01>1 there is more support for the null hypothesis. 
Thus in Bayesian hypothesis testing it is possible to build support 
for either H_0 or H_1. In essence the Bayes factor is a measure of the
relative strength of evidence. There is no standard guideline 
for recommending a decision about the prevailing hypothesis, but
several statisticians have made some suggested criteria. Jeffreys 
(1961) suggested that a Bayes factor > 10 was "strong" and BF>100 
was "decisive"; however, Kass and Raffrey (1995) suggested that 
BF>20 was "strong" and BF>150 was "decisive". Chechile (2020) argued
from a decision-theory framework for a third option for the user to
decide "not to decide" if the prevailing Bayes factor is not 
sufficiently large. From this decision-making perspective, Chechile
(2020) suggested that BF>19 was a "good bet-too good to disregard", 
whereas BF>99 was "a strong bet-irresponsible to avoid" and 
BF>20,001 was "virtually certain". Yet Chechile pointed out that 
despite the Bayes factor value there is often some probability, 
however small, for either hypothesis. Ultimately each academic 
discipline has to set the standard for their field for the
strength of evidence. Yet even when the Bayes factor is below 
the user's threshold for making claims about the hypotheses, the
value of the Bayes factor from one study can be nonetheless 
valuable to other researchers and might be combined via a product
rule in a meta-analysis. So, the value of the Bayes factor has
a descriptive utility. 

The Bayes factor BF10 for an interval null is the ratio of the
posterior odds of H_1 to H_0 divided by the prior odds of H_1 to H_0. 
Also the converse Bayes factor BF01 is the ratio of posterior odds of 
H_0 to H_1 divided by the prior odds of H_0 to H_1; hence BF01=1/BF10.
If there is no change in the odds ratio as a function of new data 
being collected, then BF10=BF01=1. But if evidence is more likely for 
one of the hypotheses, then either BF10 or BF01 will be greater than
1. 

The population parameter phi is distributed on the continuous interval
[0,1]. The prior and posterior beta distribution are probability 
density displays. Importantly this means that no point has a nonzero 
probability. Alternatively it means that the probability for any 
mathematical point is zero. For this reason all point null hypotheses 
have a probability measure of zero, but they can have a probability 
density that can be different for prior and posterior distributions. 
Interestingly there still is a meaningful Bayes factor for a point 
hypothesis. As described in Chechile (2020) 
BF10 = [P(H1|D)/P(H1)][P(H0)/P(H0|D)] where D denotes the data. The 
first term in this equation is 1/1=1. But the second term is of the 
form of 0/0, which appears to undefined. However, by using 
L'Hospital's rule, it can be proved the term P(H0)/P(H0|D) is the 
ratio of prior probability density at the null point divided by the 
posterior probability density. This method for finding the Bayes 
factor for a point is called the Savage-Dickey method because of the
separate contributions from both of those statisticians (Dickey & 
Lientz, 1970). One alternative method for assessing an approximately 
sharp null rate with a Bayes factor is to use a narrow interval 
around the null point (e.g. Chechile, 2020). For example, the null 
hypothesis might be the interval [null_point-.005, null_point+.005]. 
In this case interval-form BF10 and BF01 are well defined as 
described above.     

The dfba_beta_bayes_factor () function requires that the prior
beta shape parameter a0 and b0 to be positive. It is also required 
that a>=a0 and b>=b0 because binomial frequencies for successes 
and failures (i.e., n1 and n2) cannot be negative and because
a=n1+a0 and b=n2+b0.

Finally the user should be aware that the Bayes factor is dependent
on the prior. The following hypothetical example illustrates this
fact and also illustrates the combination of Bayes factor values
across different samples. For this example, suppose the researcher
is interested in the null hypothesis that the binomial rate parameter
is in the narrow interval of [.745,.755], and the initial prior is a
uniform distribution (i.e., a0=b0=1). For the first sample n1=77 and
n2=21, so a=1+77=78 and b=1+21=22. The Bayes factor in favor of the
null hypothesis is found from the dfba_beta_bayes_factor () program
is BF01=7.285314. Next there is a second sample that is obtained 
where n1=148 and n2=52. The researcher uses the posterior from the 
first sample, so a0=78 and b0=22. Thus the posterior from the second 
sample is a beta distribution with a=78+148=226 and b=22+52=74. The 
Bayes factor for the second study is found to be BF01=2.517042. 
Note that the Bayes factor is smaller from that found in the first
sample because the posterior odds between the hypotheses has not 
changed as much from the prior odds. Yet if the researcher did 
not do the analysis of the data in two separate batches, then the 
total for the binomial outcomes would be n1=225 and n2=73. Given 
the initial uniform prior where a0=1 and b0=1, the posterior beta 
has the beta shape parameters of a=1+225=226 and b=1+73=74. Note 
that the posterior beta is the same as the one obtained 
previously when the data was examined sequentially. The Bayes 
factor for the one-step process is BF01=18.33744 because the 
posterior odds have made a large change from the prior odds that 
was based on the uniform prior. The one-step Bayes factor is also 
equal to the product of the two-step Bayes factor values 
(i.e., 7.285314 X 2.517042 = 18.33744).
