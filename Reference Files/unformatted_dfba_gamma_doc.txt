Goodman-Kruskal Gamma

Description

Given bivariate data in the form of either a rank-ordered table 
or a matrix, this function computes the number of concordant 
changes nc between the variates and the number of discordant 
changes nd. The program also computes the Goodman-Kruskal 
gamma statistic, which is defined as (nc-nd)/(nc+nd). The function
further provides a Bayesian analysis of the population concordance 
proportion parameter phi, which is the limit of the ratio nc/(nc+nd). 
This parameter is same value as the phi parameter found for
bivariate vectors with the dfba_phi() program.


Usage

dfba_gamma(
  x,
  a.prior = 1,
  b.prior = 1,
  interval.width = 0.95
 )
  
Arguments

x			A matrix or table where the I-J element is 
			the frequency of scores where measure 1 
			has as a rank of I and the corresponding 
			measure 2 has a rank of J

a.prior			First shape parameter for the prior beta 
			distribution (default is 1)

b.prior			Second shape parameter for the prior beta 
			distribution (default is 1)

interval.width		Desired width for interval estimates 
			(default is 95%)


Details

If there is a bivariate study where the two measures are 
restricted on an ordinal scale, such as when the two variates
are ranked data over a limited set of intergers, then an ordered 
contingency table is often a convenient data representation. 
For such a case the element in the I-J cell of the matrix is 
the frequency of occasions where one variate has a rank value 
of I while the corresponding rank for the other variate is 
J. This situation is a special case of the more general case 
where there are two continuous bivariate measures. For the special 
case of a rank-order matrix with frequencies, there is a 
distribution-free concordance correlation that is in common usage - 
the Goodman-Kruskal gamma (see Siegel & Castellan, 1988). 

Chechile (2020) showed that the Goodman-Kruskal gamma is 
equivalent to the more general Kendall tau_A coefficient. 
Historically gamma was considered a different metric from 
the Kendall tau because typically the Kendall coefficient
in standard use was tau_B, which is a flawed metric
because it does not properly correct for ties. See the 
documentation for the dfba_phi() function for a more 
extensive discussion about the Kendall tau_A and the 
flawed tau_B correlation. Note users should be warned 
that the base R instruction cor(x,y,method="kendall") 
reports the tau_B correlation which is incorrect when 
there are ties! The correct tau_A is computed by the
dfba_phi() function.

The gamma statistic is equal to (nc-nd)/(nc+nd) where
nc is the number of occasions when the variates change 
in a concordant way and nd is the number of occasions 
when the variates change in a discordant fashion. The value
of nc for an order matrix is the sum of terms for each IJ 
that are equal to n_ij*N^{+}_ij where n_ij is the frequency 
for cell IJ and N^{+}_ij is the sum of a frequencies in the 
matrix where the row value is greater than I and where the 
column value is greater than J. The value nd is the sum of 
terms for each IJ that are n_ij*N^{-}_ij where N^{-}-ij is 
the sum of the frequencies in the matrix where row value is 
greater than I and the column value is less than J. The nc 
and nd values computed in this fashion are respectively 
equal to nc and nd value found when the bivariates measures 
are entered as paired vectors into the dfba_phi() function. 

As with the dfba_phi() program, the Bayesian analysis is 
focused on the population concordance proportion phi. Also
gamma=(2*phi -1). The likelihood function, as with the
analysis discussed for the dfba_phi() function, is proportional 
to [(phi^nc)*(1-phi)^nd]. The prior is a beta function, and the 
posterior is the conjugate beta where a.post=a.prior+nc and 
b.post=b.prior+nd.
