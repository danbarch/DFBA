## Main program to run a test of the 14 functions in the
# DFBA package. For this function to work DFBA package
# must be installed in the R workspace as well as the
# the following separate functions which are test_beta_descriptive,
# test_wilcoxon, test_mann, test_sim,test_power1, test_power2,test_gamma,
# test_beta_contrast,test_beta_bayes_factor,test_binomial,test_dfba_sign,
# test_mcnemar,test_dfba_median,test_concordance
# The output of the 14 functions tested is a vector that has elements
# that are either 0 or 1. The 1 is for function tests that do not pass.
# If all 14 output vectors of test_DFBA_main are 0's then the whole
# package of 14 functions passed the designed set of tests. The interpretation
# of a 1 for any of the output vectors is contained in the documentation
# of the appropriate specific function test. For example a 1 in the first of
# 17 elements in the output vector for testing the dfba_median_test denotes
# that the combined median of the two groups is incorrect.
